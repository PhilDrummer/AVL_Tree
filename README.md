This is a very basic implementation of an AVL-Tree in C, by Philipp Schaad. The implementation is done in a modular style, allowing quick and easy integration of the AVL-Tree in to any type of program.

### In Short: ###

* This is a very basic implementation of an AVL-Tree in C. Modular design allows quick and easy integration in any C/C++ project.
* Current Version: 1.0.0

### How do I get set up? ###

* If you want to use the AVL-Tree Module, you need to copy the avl_core.c and avl_core.h files in to your project folder, and include avl_core.h.
* The core-module itself does not contain a main method. If you need one, you will have to supply one yourself. Alternatively you can copy the test-avl.c file in to you project, which contains a main method. The method simply tests the AVL-Tree.
* Dependencies
* Database configuration
* How to run tests
* Deployment instructions
