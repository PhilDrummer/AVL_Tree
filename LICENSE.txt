   DON'T BE A DICK PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION.           
						      
------------------------------------------------------

1. Do whatever you like with the original work,
   just don't be a dick.

   Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the
   following instances:

   1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just
       copy this and change the name.
   1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work
       done what-so-ever. That's REALLY being a dick.
   1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden
       harmful content. That would make you a PROPER
       dick.

------------------------------------------------------

2. If you become rich through modifications, related
   works/services, or supporting the original work,
   share the love. Only a dick would make loads off
   this work and not buy the original works creator(s)
   a pint.

------------------------------------------------------

3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody
   else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes
   you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-
   dick would submit the fix back.

------------------------------------------------------

4. If you decide to use this code or parts of it in
   your work, give a short mention of the original
   author(s) and maybe a reference back to the owners
   GitHub page or the likes. Only a real dick would
   take all the credit for himself.
